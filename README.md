## Description 
    This content management systems uses a command line interface to keep track of employees in a company. It uses a PostgreSQL database to log departments in a company, their roles, and employees that fall under each role. With this application, companies can better keep track of employees and their respective roles using unique ids that are automatically provided for every employee. 

## Installation
    In order to run this application, first you must run that schema .sql file in PostgreSQL to create the database. Next, you must seed the database with either the data provided in seed.sql or your own data listing departments, roles, and employees. After that, all you need to do is run the application using node app.js in the terminal! Hope this is helpful!

## Usage
    First, you must run the schema.sql file using PostgreSQL. Next, add your data or the mock data provided in the seed.sql file. Finally, run "node app.js" in your command terminal to start the application.
